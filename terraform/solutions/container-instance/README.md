## Example: Provisioning via Container Instance

This example provisions the Example Container as an Azure Container Instance, connected to an Azure Redis Cache.

You can apply this using `terraform apply` - which upon completion will output the URL where this application runs.

Once you're done, you can destroy all of the created resources using `terraform destroy`.
